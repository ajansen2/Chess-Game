Chess game project copyright notice and license.

Copyright (C) 2023 Members of Group 4: Adam Jansen, Aditya Aggarwal,
Christopher Bury, Dalton Herrewynen, and Hamza Mhamdi. All Rights Reserved.

I, Dalton Herrewynen, write this file on behalf of my group members.

Each group member retains full ownership to the code he wrote. History and
authorship is trivial to verify via the Git version control repository. All of
my commits are signed with one of my GPG keys (find them listed in Authors.md).
My signatures are indirectly protecting the security of the other Git commits
which are not signed, though their security is still not as strong as the ones
I have signed.

License is granted to all group members as noted in the Authors.md file for
display, running, compiling, and modification for use in their future projects.

The primary reason I write this is because some of my code solutions were
borrowed from other projects I am working on personally. I do not wish to grant
ownership to anyone of any code that I have written.

Because this is a school project, I do grant a license to The Kings University
and its staff and faculty to use, display run, compile into executable files,
and demonstrate my code. I do not grant them ownership of any work that I have
done here. I retain the sole ownership of any work I do. I understand that
The Kings University requires certain rights in order to grade the project, I
allow this usage. However, I retain the full ownership and authorship of my
work and anything I derive from it.

Unless specified otherwise, the other members of Group 4 affirm their ownership
and authorship over their own work, grant license rights to the other Group 4
members, and to The Kings University and its faculty exactly as I have.

The other group members can choose to affirm my statement as their own at next
to my own signature at the bottom of this file.

License is hereby granted to The Kings University to store, compile, run, and
display this project and its work for grading and educational purposes.
Ownership and authorship is held by the physical person who created any given
work. For authenticity, my GPG signature should be sufficient to prove the Git
history is intact given no one has access to my GPG keys, and it is unlikely
that someone has been maliciously submitting Git commits pretending to be
someone else.

Signatures below license are only valid if license text digital signature is
valid.
